<h2>Introduction</h2>










This page provides access to the XML computable expression of the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR
terminology, and a set of tools to support the use of this terminology
in a variety of contexts including the Archetype Editor. The <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR terminology (<a href="../../terminology.pdf">documentary specification</a>) is an adjunct to the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR
reference and archetype models, and provides code sets and vocabularies
needed by the models which are language independent. It is not a "real-world" ontology of any kind -
i.e. it does not contain representation of facts in areas such as
diseases or biochemistry - this is the job of much larger terminologies
such as ICDx, ICPC, SNOMED-CT and so on.<br>









<br>









The file contains:<br>









<ul>









  <li>Concepts used in the reference model that are DV_CODED_TEXTs and are specified as coming from the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR
Terminology. These concepts are grouped and have a group identifier.
The group identifier can be found in the terminology tool provided from
this site.</li>









  <li>Concepts that are represented in the user interface of the archetype editor, including labels, menus and dialog box messages.</li>









  <li>Concepts that are properties (e.g. mass, area) which restrict the
set of units available in a DV_QUANTITY - this enables translation of
these concepts.</li>









  <li>Language codes for use with <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR (ISO).</li>








  <li>Territory codes for use with <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR (ISO).</li>









  <li>A set of terminology identifiers used by UMLS for linking archetype terms to terminologies.</li>









</ul>









It presently includes the translations of all languages - this will be handled in separate files in future.<br>









<h2>File structure</h2>
The terminology file now in widest use is the Java project one, which can be found <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_java/TRUNK/mini-termserv/src/main/resources/openehr_terminology_en.xml">here</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_java/TRUNK/mini-termserv/src/main/resources/openehr_terminology_en.xml"></a>The original file can be found <a href="../../../../architecture/computable/terminology/terminology.xml">here</a>. The associated schema is <a href="../../../../architecture/computable/terminology/terminology.xsd">here</a>. &nbsp;The schema is an XML schema - <a href="Terminology.xsd.html">documentation</a> of this file is provided.








<h2>Tools</h2>






Tools for manipulating the terminology have been developed for the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR Foundation by <a href="http://www.oceaninformatics.biz/">Ocean Informatics</a>.


Two tools are provided to manage this small terminology. Please note
that the Terminology tool is provided for interest - any wanting to translate or alter this termset needs to <a href="mailto:contact@oceaninformatics.biz">contact</a> Ocean Informatics
to ensure the upgrade is coordinated. The Translation tool can be used
independently, submitting the translated Terminology.xml file to Ocean Informatics for
incorporation into the main file. (As explained above, the language
specific files will be distributed separately in future). The files are:<br>









<ol>









  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR Terminology
tool which allows the user to expand the terminology, add groups and
edit any concepts in any language. This tool includes the translation
tool.</li>









  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR Translation
tool which allows the user to translate the terminology to a new
language. This can display all terms, or only those that are requiring
translation.</li>









</ol>


The tools are
provided as .Zipped .exe files. They need to be saved
to and run in the same directory as the Terminology.xml file.<br>


<ul>









  






  <li><a href="http://www.oceaninformatics.biz/terminology/openEHR_Terminology.zip">Terminology tool</a></li>


  <li><a href="http://www.oceaninformatics.biz/terminology/openEHR_Translation.zip">Translation tool</a></li>









</ul>










<h2>Future Work</h2>









The current design of the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR Support Terminology is adequate for the
purpose but there are&nbsp;potential improvements to this design.
The most critical of these is to separate the language specific terms from
the master concepts and groups. The current tools are written in VB.Net by Ocean
Informatics - the source code of these applications can be made
available to those seeking to improve this terminology.<br>
