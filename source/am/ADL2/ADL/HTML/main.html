<A NAME="pgfId-1148811"></A>File-naming Convention</h2>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1148812"></A>Up until ADL 1.4, archetypes were expressed in ‘flat’ form ADL and were saved in files with the extension ‘.adl’. These are now treated as legacy flat format files. Beginning with ADL 1.5, the source file format of an archetype is the ‘differential’ form, with the extension ‘.adls’. The flat format being generated by tools, and now has the extension ‘.adlf’. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1148480"></A>For specialised archetypes, differential form follows the object-oriented convention and only includes overridden or new elements but not unchanged inherited elements. Inherited elements are determined by compiling and ‘flattening’ a differential archetype with respect to the parent archetypes in its <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
inheritance lineage</EM>
. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1148487"></A>For top-level archetypes the full structure is included in the differential file, but internal references, where they exist, are expanded out in the flat form. </P>

<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1147292"></A>The first word in a source ADL archetype declares the artefact type, and is one of the following keywords:</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="LstV1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1147393"></A>‘archetype’: signifies an archetype;</LI>

<DIV>
<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1147284"></A>8.3.3	Node Identifier Codes</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1134449"></A>In the <CODE CLASS="Code">
definition</CODE>
 section of an ADL archetype, a specific set of codes is used as node identifiers. Identifier codes always appear in brackets (<CODE CLASS="Code">
[]</CODE>
), and begin with the ‘id’ prefix. Specialisations of locally coded concepts have the same root, followed by ‘dot’ extensions, e.g. <CODE CLASS="Code">
[id10.2]</CODE>
. From a terminology point of view, these codes have no implied semantics - the ‘dot’ structuring is used as an optimisation on node identification.</P>
<UL>
<P CLASS="Deprecated">
<A NAME="pgfId-1150582"></A>In ADL 1.4 and transitional forms of ADL 1.5, ‘at’ codes were used as node identifiers. Within top-level archetypes, the code numbers were 0-padded to make up a 4-digit code, e.g. ‘at0004’. In ADL 2, all such codes are replaced by an ‘id’ code whose number is one greater than the original at-code number. This numeric change is to accommodate the conversion of the root identifier code at0000 to id1 rather than id0.</P>
</UL>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1150549"></A>8.3.4	Local Term Codes</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1150550"></A>In the <CODE CLASS="Code">
definition</CODE>
 section of an ADL archetype, a second set of codes is used for terms denoting constraints on coded items. Term codes are either local to the archetype, or from an external lexicon. This means that the archetype description is the same in all languages, and is available in any language that the codes have been translated to. All term codes are shown in brackets (<CODE CLASS="Code">
[]</CODE>
) and are prefixed with “at”, e.g. <CODE CLASS="Code">
at10</CODE>
. Codes of any length are acceptable in ADL archetypes. Specialisations of locally coded concepts have the same root, followed by ‘dot’ extensions, e.g. <CODE CLASS="Code">
at10.2</CODE>
. From a terminology point of view, these codes have no implied semantics - the ‘dot’ structuring is used as an optimisation on node identification.</P>
<UL>
<P CLASS="Deprecated">
<A NAME="pgfId-1150613"></A>In ADL 1.4 and transitional forms of ADL 1.5, 0-padded ‘at’ codes were used within top-level archetypes. In ADL 2, all such codes are reformatted to remove the 0-padding.</P>
</UL>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1139029"></A>8.3.5	<A NAME="70808"></A>Local Constraint Codes</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1118866"></A>A third kind of local code is used to stand for constraints on code text items in the body of the archetype. Although these could be included in the main archetype body, because they are language- and/or terminology-sensitive, they are defined in the terminology section, and referenced by codes prefixed by “ac”, e.g. <CODE CLASS="Code">
[ac9]</CODE>
.</P>
<UL>
<P CLASS="Deprecated">
<A NAME="pgfId-1150635"></A>In ADL 1.4 and transitional forms of ADL 1.5, 0-padded ‘ac’ codes were used within top-level archetypes. In ADL 2, all such codes are reformatted to remove the 0-padding.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1118083"></A>Archetype Identification Section</h2>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149271"></A>This section introduces the archetype with the keyword ‘archetype’ ‘template’, ‘template_overlay’ or ‘operational_archetype’, followed by a number of items of meta-data in parentheses, and on the next line, a human-readable archetype identifier.

<A NAME="pgfId-1152187"></A>8.4.1	ADL Version Indicator</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152188"></A>An ADL version identifier is mandatory in all archetypes, and is expressed as a string of the form <CODE CLASS="Code">
adl_version=N.M</CODE>
, or <CODE CLASS="Code">
N.M.P</CODE>
, where <CODE CLASS="Code">
N.M[.P]</CODE>
 is the ADL release identifier.</P>

<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151963"></A>8.4.2	Machine Identifiers</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151964"></A>A unique identifier for the archetype in the form of a GUID can be specified using the syntax below:</P>
    archetype (adl_version=2.0.5; uid=15E82D77-7DB7-4F70-8D8E-EED6FF241B2D)
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151966"></A>This identifier is set at initial creation or at any time later, and nevre subsequently changes. It acts as an identifier for the physical artefact, regardless of what semantics are changed, including changes to the constituent parts of the multi-axial identifier.</P>

<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149544"></A>8.4.3	Namespaces</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1146429"></A>A namespaced archetype will have an identification section like the following examples:</P>
<pre>
    archetype (adl_version=2.0.5)
    	br.gov.saude::openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.haematology_result.v1.0.0
    &nbsp;
    template (adl_version=2.0.5)

    archetype (adl_version=2.0.5)
    	org.openehr::openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.haematology_result.v3.22.125-rc.7
    &nbsp;
</pre>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149482"></A>Namespaces are used to distinguish locally created artefacts representing a given concept (such as ‘haematology result’) from an artefact created elsewhere intended to represent the same concept.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149489"></A>Once a namespace is attached to an archetype, it is considered a part of the identifier, and never changed, even if the archetype moves to a new publishing organisation. This ensures the constant relationship between archetypes and the data created using them.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149557"></A>8.4.4	Human Readable Archetype Identifier</h3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152230"></A>The archetype identifier may include a namespace, in the form of a reverse domain name, which denotes the original authoring organisation. The lack of a namespace in the identifier indicates an ad hoc, uncontrolled artefact, not formally associated with any organisation, typical for experimental archetypes, and pre-ADL 1.5 archetypes not yet upgraded to have a namespace. The main part of the identifier is multi-axial concept identifier.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152231"></A>A typical identification sectionfor an ad hoc archetype is as follows:</P>
<pre>
    archetype (adl_version=2.0.5)
    	openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.haematology_result.v0.1.9
    &nbsp;
</pre>
<UL>
<P CLASS="Deprecated">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152235"></A>In ADL 1.4 and transitional forms of ADL 1.5, archetype identifiers included only a single version number, and this typically started at 1. Tools that deal with older archetypes should accept these identifiers, and convert the version part to ‘v1.0.0’ or any other appropriate identifier, obeying the openEHR Artefact Knowledge Identification specification.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152222"></A>The multi-axial archetype identifier identifies archetypes in a global concept space within a given namespace. It is also known as an ‘ontological’ identifier, since the concept space can be understood as an ontology of informational concepts on which the archetypes are based. The syntax of the identifier is described in the Identification section of the openEHR Support IM specification. The structure of the concept space is essentially two-level, with the first level being a reference model class (e.g. openEHR <CODE CLASS="Code">
OBSERVATION</CODE>
 class) and the second being a domain concept (e.g. ‘haematology result’).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149607"></A>Because namespaces are usually treated hierarchically, higher level namespaces (e.g. ‘.org’ domains) are assumed to be includable by more local namespaces, with the result that the concept definition space is inherited as well.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1150183"></A>The semantics of the ontological identifier are described in detail in the <A HREF="http://www.openehr.org/releases/trunk/architecture/am/knowledge_id_system.pdf" CLASS="URL">Knowledge Artefact Identification specification</A>.</P>

<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149417"></A>8.4.5	Specialised Archetype Identification</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149708"></A>The archetype identifier of any specialised archetype, including all templates, follows the same rules as for non-specialised archetypes.</P>
<UL>
<P CLASS="Deprecated">
<A NAME="pgfId-1149709"></A>Note: in previous versions of ADL, the archetype identifier of a specialised archetype had a concept part that consisted of the concept part of the parent followed by ‘-’ and a further specialised concept. For example, <CODE CLASS="Code">
openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.haematology-cbc.v1</CODE>
 was a valid child of <CODE CLASS="Code">
openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.haematology.v1</CODE>
. This restriction is no longer the case. The previous style of identifier is still legal, but the ‘-’ no longer has any significance.</P>

<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151485"></A>8.4.6	Version Identifiers</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151486"></A>ADL 2 Archetypes contain 3-part version identifiers, with optional qualifiers, following the openEHR Artefact Knowledge Identification specification. Examples below:</P>
<pre>

<A NAME="pgfId-1146369"></A>8.4.8	Generated Indicator</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1146370"></A>A flag indicating whether the archetype was generated or authored can be included after the version, as follows:</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1151881"></A>This marker is used to support the migration to differential archetype representation introduced in ADL 1.5, to enable proper representation of specialised archetypes. The ‘generated’ marker can be used on specialised archetypes - i.e. ADL 1.5 style .adls files - generated from flat archetypes - ADL 1.4 .adl files - and also in flat archetypes generated from differential files, by an inheritance-flattening process.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<h3 CLASS="Hdr3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152092"></A>8.4.9	Controlled Indicator</h3>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152093"></A>A flag indicating whether the archetype is change-controlled or not can be included after the version, as follows:</P>
<pre>
    archetype (adl_version=2.0.5; controlled)
    	org.openehr::openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.haematology.v1.2.0
</pre>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1152096"></A>This flag may have the two values “controlled” and “uncontrolled” only, and is an aid to software. Archetypes that include the “controlled” flag should have the revision history section included, while those with the “uncontrolled” flag, or no flag at all, may omit the revision history. This enables archetypes to be privately edited in an early development phase without generating large revision histories of little or no value.</P>

<h2 CLASS="Hdr2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151886"></A>Specialise Section</h2>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151887"></A>This optional section indicates that the archetype is a specialisation of some other archetype, whose identity must be given.

<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1145661"></A>All archetype object constraint nodes require a node identifier. When data are created according to the <CODE CLASS="Code">
definition</CODE>
 section of an archetype, the archetype node identifiers can be written into the data, providing a reliable way of finding data nodes, regardless of what other runtime names might have been chosen by the user for the node in question. There are two reasons for doing this. Firstly, querying cannot rely on runtime names of nodes (e.g. names like “sys BP”, “systolic bp”, “sys blood press.” entered by a doctor are unreliable for querying); secondly, it allows runtime data retrieved from a persistence mechanism to be re-associated with the cADL structure which was used to create it.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1145662"></A>An example which shows the difference between design-time meanings associated with node identifiers and runtime names is the following, from a <CODE CLASS="Code">

 archetype representing the problem/SOAP headings (a simple heading structure commonly used by clinicians to record patient contacts under top-level headings corresponding to the patient’s problem(s), and under each problem heading, the headings “subjective”, “objective”, “assessment”, and “plan”).</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1145669"></A>	In the above, the node identifier <CODE CLASS="Code">

 is assigned a meaning such as “clinical problem” in the archetype terminology section. The subsequent lines express a constraint on the runtime <EM CLASS="Emphasis">

 attribute, using the internal code <CODE CLASS="Code">
[ac1]</CODE>
. The constraint <CODE CLASS="Code">
[ac1]</CODE>
 is also defined in the archetype terminology section with a formal statement meaning “any clinical problem type”, which could clearly evaluate to thousands of possible values, such as “diabetes”, “arthritis” and so on. As a result, in the runtime data, the node identifier corresponding to “clinical problem” and the actual problem type chosen at runtime by a user, e.g. “diabetes”, can both be found. This enables querying to find all nodes with meaning “problem”, or all nodes describing the problem “diabetes”. Internal <CODE CLASS="Code">

Some terminologies (notably LOINC, the laboratory terminology in this example) define ‘pre-coordinated’ codes, such as ‘1 hour body temperature’; these clearly correspond not to single codes such as id4 in the archetype, but to whole paths. In such cases, the key in each term binding row is a full path rather than a single term.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1148114"></A>Typically annotations are used to document a particular node within an archetype, specified by its (unique) archetype path. In some cases, the archetype (or tempate) author wants to document the use of a reference model attribute that is not constrained in the archetype (and therefore does not have an archetype path as such). In this case, the path will just be a valid RM path, i.e. a path relative to the top-level object of the archetype, and containing no at-codes. </P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1146733"></A>Revision History Section</h2>
<P CLASS="BodyFirst">
<A NAME="pgfId-1140359"></A>The revision history section of an archetype shows the audit history of changes to the archetype, and is expressed in ODIN syntax. It is optional, and is included at the end of the archetype, since it does not contain content of direct interest to archetype authors, and will monotonically grow in size. Where archetypes are stored in a version-controlled repository such as CVS or some commercial product, the revision history section would normally be regenerated each time by the authoring software, e.g. via processing of the output of the ‘prs’ command used with SCCS files, or ‘rlog’ for RCS files. The following shows a typical example, with entries in most-recent-first order (although technically speaking, the order is irrelevant to ADL).</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151686"></A>Terminology constraints are an alternative to enumeration of value sets within an archetype. Inline enumeration will work perfectly well in a technical sense, but has at least two limitations. Firstly, the intended set of values allowed for the attribute may change over time (e.g. as has happened with ‘types of hepatitis’ since 1980), and since the authoritative resource is elsewhere, the archetype has to be continually updated. With a large repository of archetypes, each containing inline coded term constraints, this approach is likely to be unsustainable and error-prone. Secondly, the best means of defining the value set is in general not likely to be via enumeration of the individual terms, but in the form of a semantic expression that can be evaluated against the external resource. This is because the value set is typically logically specified in terms of inclusions, exclusions, conjunctions and disjunctions of general categories.</P>
<UL>
<P CLASS="Discussion">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151687"></A>Consider for example the value set logically defined as “any bacterial infection of the lung”. The possible values would be codes from a target terminology, corresponding to numerous strains of pneumococcus, staphlycoccus and so on, but not including species that are never found in the lung. Rather than enumerate the list of codes corresponding to this value set (which is likely to be quite large), the archetype author is more likely to rely on semantic links within the external terminology to express the set; a query such as ‘is-a bacteria and has-site lung’ is definable against the SNOMED-CT terminology for example.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="DiscussionCont">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151688"></A>In a similar way, other value sets, including for quantitative values, are likely to be specified by queries or formal expressions, and evaluated by an external knowledge service. Examples include “any unit of pressure” and “normal range values for serum sodium”.</P>
<P CLASS="DiscussionCont">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151689"></A>In such cases, expressing the terminology constraint could be done by including the query or other formal expression directly within the archetype itself. However, experience shows that this is problematic in various ways. Firstly, there is little if any standardisation in such formal value set expressions or queries for use with knowledge services - two archetype authors could easily create competing syntactical expressions for the same logical constraint. A second problem is that errors might be made in the query expression itself, or the expression may be correct at the time of authoring, but need subsequent adjustment as the relevant knowledge resource grows and changes. The consequence of this is the same as for a value set enumerated inline - it is unlikely to be sustainable for large numbers of archetypes. </P>
<P CLASS="DiscussionCont">
<A NAME="pgfId-1151690"></A>These problems are not accidental: a query with respect to a terminological, ontological or other knowledge resource is most likely to be authored correctly by maintainers or experts of the knowledge resource, rather than archetype authors; it may well be altered over time due to improvements in the query formalism itself.</P>
